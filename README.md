# ReactNativeDemo

This project demostrates best practices using react native. In this project there are a few important aspects:
1. It ultilizes reusable components. Check Button.js for instance.
2. Performs async functions using axios to retrieve data that then sets a state in AlbumList.js
3. Uses Linking API from React Native to link a url to the browser
4. Properly uses flexbox to position UI elements in the app.
5. Retrives a Scrollview component from react native and ultilizes my proper uses of flexbox to allow scrollability.
